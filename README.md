# Whole-genome resequencing reveals the population structure, genomic diversity, and demographic history of American chestnut

This repository contains the scripts associated with the Sandercock et al., (2022) preprint. For this study, we performed whole-genome resequencing for 384 Castanea dentata and 95 other Castanea species. The goal was to evaluate the patterns of genomic diversity and selection within wild American chestnut populations to aid in restoration efforts.

The preprint associated with this study can be found at bioRxiv here. The scripts are subdivided into the following directories:

- RAiSD_jupyter_notebook contains the jupyter notebook of python scripts associated with the RAiSD method section.

- SNP_calling contains the bash scripts needed to generate the SNP datasets used.

- R_notebooks contains the R notebooks used to identify the RAiSD outlier regions and generate the raw figures for this study.
