This repository contains the scripts associated with the Sandercock et al., (2022) Molecular Ecology paper. For this study, we performed whole-genome resequencing for 384 Castanea dentata and 95 other Castanea species. The goal was to evaluate the patterns of genomic diversity and selection within wild American chestnut populations to aid in restoration efforts.

The preprint associated with this study can be found at bioRxiv [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.11.480151v1). The scripts are subdivided into the following directories:

- Python_scripts contains the jupyter notebook of python scripts associated with the RAiSD method section.

- Variant_calling_pipeline contains the variant calling scripts needed to generate the SNP datasets.
