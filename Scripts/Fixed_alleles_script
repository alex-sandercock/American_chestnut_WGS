#First need to prepare vcf file using bcftools, may be able to not use python at all and only use bcftools.
#Make sure individuals included have less than 10% missing data, otherwise any site that is missing data will be removed.
#Although a fixed allele is defined as being found in 100% of individuals in a population, should we define a threshold to account for missing data from sequencing?

#Remove header, include only snps, remove any sites that are heterozygous or missing, remove uncalled genotypes
#Sites that are missing or heterozygous in at least 1 individual will be removed for all.
