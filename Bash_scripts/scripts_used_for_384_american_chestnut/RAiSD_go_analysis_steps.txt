#Step 1
Perform RAiSD analysis on each population separately from a separate VCF file for each population. #Refer to RAiSD notes for the steps

#Step 2
In R, make a table of the 0.999 percentile SNPs and Windows for each population.

#Step 3
-Convert those tables into a tab-deliminated list of CHROM POS or CHROM START END
-Use bcftools to make a vcf file of only those signifificant SNPs or significant windows #Note, the 'SNPs' are arbitrarily the central location of the sliding window that was found to be significant.
bcftools view --regions-file North_Pops_RAiSD_999_percentile_mid_window.txt American_chestnut_North_Pop_filtered_remove_fail_miss_0.9.vcf.gz -Oz -o North_Pop_RAiSD_999_percentile_mid_window_SNPs.vcf.gz --threads 5

#Step 4
-Perform SNPeff
-Use the significant SNP vcf files and the C. dentata gff file as input
-Output is an annotated vcf file.

#Step5
-Use SNPsift?

#Step 6
-get table of annotated genes for plotting for each population.
-(Make a bar chart of gene funtions with a lower bar of number of significant SNPs)
-How to address that many of these SNPs are in LD?

##Using Phytozome BLAST search instead
#Step 4 alternative
-convert the tab-deliminated list into BED files
-use BEDTOOLS getfasta to make a fasta file of the sequences for each significant window
$HOME/bin/bedtools getfasta -fo Central_RAiSD_999_percent_windows_phytozome.fasta -fi /home/amsand/chestnut_genome/Castanea_dentata.mainGenome.fasta -bed central_Pops_RAiSD_999_percentil
e_bed.bed

#Step 5 - BLAST
-input the fasta file of sequences for each population into the phytozome website for the C.dentata genome.
