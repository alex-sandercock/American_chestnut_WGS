#VCF Filtering (this is after the GATK filtering and 0.9% VCF filtering that are in the 05,06,07 scripts)

1. Individuals with greater than 10% missing genotypes were removed (18 samples)
	#Individuals were identified for having missing data by using vcftools stats and analysing in R.
1b. This was also applied to the 95 Castanea species dataset where SATI16, MOLL06, and PUMI08 were removed.
2. INDELs were removed to only keep SNPs
3. MAF was filtered based on 1/2N, where N was the number of individuals retatined (366)
		#1/(2*366) = 0.00136612 | So, I used 0.001
4. VCF of species ref samples were compared to dentata vcf using ADMIXTURE. Individuals from the dentata subset that had greater than 10% Admixture where removed.

5.The original dentata vcd (384 samples) was then re-filtered (step 2,3) without the hybrids and samples with missing data.

5a. This resulted in a dentata vcf of 356 individuals. The new MAF filter was a slightly larger 0.002.

6. ##FOR ADMIXTURE plink was used to perform LD pruning on the filtered VCF.

7. ##FOR SMC++ The filtered VCF file including the 0.002 maf filter, but no LD pruning, was used to perform demographic history.

8. ##EEMS used the filtered 356 vcf file with the maf filter and no ld pruning
